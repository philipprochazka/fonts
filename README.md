### What`s  the difference 

## How to use It: 

+! Windows
 
should be used with TTF binaries
    , but it works also with the "Open type format eg. .otf" ok


$fontDestination = "$env:SystemRoot\Fonts\$(Split-Path -Leaf $filePath)"


* linux does prefer the OTF format, but you can make ttf work aswell.
but they should work on Mac, FreeBSD.  no problem.
 Heaven forbid something happen and they get wiped out, plus off my other backups. You never know.
####It's taken me a while to collect these. 
Many of these are free fonts, creative commons, and some are paid fonts that I've bought. Just like when they're in Texas, *they all should have their licenses* with them.

These are fonts I've used projects, for clients, or just happened to like them. Quite a few have ligatures.
